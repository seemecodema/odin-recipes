        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Many people prefer canned cranberry sauce 
            during the holidays - these people are wrong. Homemade
            cranberry sauce is extremely easy to make and vastly 
            superior to a can-shaped brick of gelatin.</p>
        <p>This recipe utilizes orange zest - while some may be tempted 
            to skip this step it is strongly recommended not to do so as 
            it greatly enhances the flavor. Simple yet effective touches
            like this separate civilized folk from beasts who need only a 
            can opener to facilitate &ldquo;good eating.&rdquo;</p>
