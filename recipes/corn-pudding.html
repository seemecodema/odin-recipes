        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Corn pudding is an old Kershner family recipe usually enjoyed 
            on Thanksgiving or Christmas. It is similar to cornbread but
            has the consistency of bread pudding.</p>
        <p>All dairy ingredients may be substituted for non-dairy 
            alternatives with little difference in the final result. 
            Some older versions of the recipe call for cheddar cheese 
            to be added to the top during the last 15 minutes of baking.
            This has been omitted here, as it is disgusting.</p>
